Alien Revolt tells the story of a group of alien creatures who try to take over the Earth. Players can decide to join the human forces or the alien army, and choose between three classes of characters: Magus, Hacker, or Warrior, each of which has different attributes and abilities. Gameplay involves dueling opponents (who are within the 3km of proximity); however, the closer the opponent, the more likely that ""shots fired"" will be accurate. The purpose of gameplay is to kill opponents to gain points and to steal their possessions.","","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zd_wOXFOOk","https://www.blasttheory.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Day-of-the-Figurines-A-Slow-Narrative-Driven-Game-for-Mobile-Phones-Using-Text-Messaging-2007.pdf (Flintham, M., Smith, K., Benford, S., Capra, M., Green, J., Greenhalgh, C., Wright, M., & Tandavanitj, N.

Each sticker is given a relative value, the players collect the stickers by taking pictures with their phone cameras. The first team to collect $5000 worth of semacodes wins. The set-up requirement is undoubtedly a limitation, although this is largely compensated for by the finer degree of localization and physical interaction within that space.","https://d26eb5y2jukpbz.cloudfront.net/ebs/archive/osi/2005/media/05034N_b.jpg, https://live.staticflickr.com/9/18311933_a48f8b1704_b.jpg, https://live.staticflickr.com/12/18312044_74e29844e0_c.jpg","http://denniscrowley.com/conqwest/about.php","https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1111293.1111302 (Rashid, O., Mullins, I., Coulton, P., & Edwards, R.

Tron players move in real space; and GPS is used to track and locate users. GPS::Tron utilizes a cell phone that is connected—via Bluetooth—to an external GPS receiver. This racing game sets two players side-by-side on a digital grid, each driving a different colored vehicle. The players begin driving forward, leaving in their path a digital trail of their vehicle’s color. This trail forms a wall that neither player can cross again, thus making the goal of the game to trap the other player within the digital walls created by the vehicles. Players can pick bonus materials that allow them to get shields and breakthrough a trail left by opponents.The vehicles, however, do not necessarily need to be physically next to each other for the game to work. One player can begin the game on the streets of Los Angeles while the opponent begins the game on the streets of Sydney. Their locations are mapped onto the digital representation of their vehicles on the GPS interface, allowing players from around the globe to compete with each other.","https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jason_Farman/publication/288316162/figure/fig1/AS:466740988649472@1488291131964/A-Bluetooth-enabled-feature-phone-running-GPSTron-The-two-players-leave-traces-red.png, https://i1.wp.com/www.we-make-money-not-art.com/yyy/gps-foto-spielflaeche%5B1%5D.jpg?w=940, https://web.archive.org/web/20060828111457im_/http://gps-tron.datenmafia.org/images/PICT0395-klein.jpg, https://web.archive.org/web/20060828111457im_/http://gps-tron.datenmafia.org/images/siemens-wiese-small.jpg, https://web.archive.org/web/20060828111457im_/http://gps-tron.datenmafia.org/images//einstellungen.JPG","","https://ojs.library.queensu.ca/index.php/surveillance-and-society/article/view/misuse/misuses (Farman, J.

Players solve mysteries by progressing through the story and going to actual physical locations as indicated by the story. Instead of changing the gameplay on the basis of the player’s location, the game builds a virtual game environment as soon as it realizes that the player has moved. For example, at the start of the game the player’s real home can be the office, and when asked to go to another location, such as a park, the player has to move in the real world. As soon as the game detects a change in Cell ID, it prompts the player that he or she has reached the new location (the park), which in reality could be any location in the physical world. This in turn creates a virtual world as the story unfolds and the player moves back and forth through the game world until the mystery is solved.","http://www.freegamearchive.com/public/reviews/images/1/1b/1b9/resized/2-the-journey-2.jpg, http://www.freegamearchive.com/public/reviews/images/1/1b/1b9/resized/3-the-journey-2.jpg, http://www.freegamearchive.com/public/reviews/images/1/1b/1b9/resized/4-the-journey-2.jpg","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1111293.1111302 (Rashid, O., Mullins, I., Coulton, P., & Edwards, R.
